					From junior kindergarten to 6th grade, I attended Sir Samuel B. Steele Jr. P. School, a K-6 school
					located within walking distance to my house. In grade 4, I enrolled in its Extended French program, 
					where half of the subjects taught in class were spoken in French. I enjoyed the program very much, as 
					it gave me the oppurtunity to explore a new language and culture.

					For two years, from grade 7 to 8, I attended Sir Ernest Macmillan, a middle school situated right next to
					my elementary school. This meant that most of my friends from 6th grade would attend Macmillan as well. Despite
					already being familiar with most of the people in my class, I met several other students from neighbouring elementary
					schools and became well-acquainted with many students in my grade. I also continued the Extended French program for the
					entirety of my two years at the school.
