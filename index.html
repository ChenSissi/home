					My name is Sissi Chen and I have absolutely no idea what to put here.
					My life is pretty boring; all I do everyday is sleep and do my homework.
					It's starting to become a problem, actually.

						My room is painted hot pink. Yes, I know it is very bright. I painted it when I was 8 years old.
						Don't judge me.
