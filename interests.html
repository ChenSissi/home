					I started playing volleyball (not competitively) when I was in 5th grade and since then, it has been one
					of my favorite sports, along with tennis and ultimate frisbee. I am left-handed, which many people say is advantageous, although
					my lack of skill probably evens out the advantage. When the weather is nice, I enjoy going out
					to practice with some friends. There is something magical about hitting a ball with full force towards an opposing
					team that always brings a smile to my face :).

				<p class = "left-text">
					When I'm not drowning in homework or watching Youtube videos, you'll most likely find me huddled
					up under my blankets, like a hermit, immersed in a story. I enjoy books of all genres, from romance,
					to thriller, to action. However, I find that I tend to enjoy books that are either overly romantic
					or excessively gruesome and bloody. There is no in-between.
				</p>
				<p class = "left-text">
					I am not currently reading any books, due to a busy schedule, although I am planning on reading titles
					such as "<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale">The Handmaid's Tale</a>" and "<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451">Fahrenheit 451</a>" when I get the chance.

				<p class = "right-text">
					When I previously mentioned that I enjoyed reading, I didn't mention that I mostly read web-comics
					and mangas. As the case with novels, I mainly read/watch action, thriller or romance genres, although anything is fine
					as long as there is an interesting plot.
				</p>
				<p class = "right-text">
					I am currently watching "<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_Fish">Banana Fish</a>", an action/crime-thriller anime about mafia organizations situated in
					New York. Although the main characters get killed like mosquitoes, I am enjoying it so far.
